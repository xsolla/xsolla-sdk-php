An official PHP SDK for interacting with [Xsolla API](https://developers.xsolla.com/api/)

This SDK can be used for:
* obtaining an authorization token
* processing of basic webhooks (user_validation, payment, refund, etc.)

## Features

* Full customisation of Payment UI with the help of different methods of getting token.
* Client for all API methods, making your integration easy and convenient. You can use it for setting up and updating virtual currency, items and subscription plans, for managing the users balance, for checking the finance information with the help of Report API and so on.
* Convenient webhook server:
  * To start you need only one callback function.
  * All security checking already implemented: signature authentication and IP whitelisting.
  * Full customisation of notification processing logic, if standard server class doesnâ€™t suit you.
* SDK is built on Guzzle v3, and utilizes many of its features, including persistent connections, parallel requests, events and plugins (via Symfony2 EventDispatcher), service descriptions, over-the-wire logging, caching, flexible batching, and request retrying with truncated exponential back off.

## Requirements

* PHP ^7.3 or ^8.0
* The following PHP extensions are required:
  * curl
  * json

## Getting Started

Please register your [Publisher Account](https://publisher.xsolla.com/signup) and create the project.
In order to use the PHP SDK Library you'll need:
* MERCHANT_ID
* API_KEY
* PROJECT_ID
* PROJECT_KEY

You can obtain these parameters using the information in your [Company Profile](https://publisher.xsolla.com/company) and [Project Settings](https://publisher.xsolla.com/projects).

## Installation

### Installing via Composer

The recommended way to install Xsolla SDK for PHP is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/your/project
$ composer require xsolla/xsolla-sdk-php
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require '/path/to/vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Installing via Phar

You can [download the packaged phar](https://github.com/xsolla/xsolla-sdk-php/releases) and include it in your scripts to get started:

``` php
require '/path/to/xsolla.phar';
```

### Installing via Zip

You can [download the zip file](https://github.com/xsolla/xsolla-sdk-php/releases), unzip it into your project to a location of your choosing, and include the autoloader:

``` php
require '/path/to/xsolla-autoloader.php';
```

## Quick Examples

### Receive webhooks

There is a build in server class to help you to handle the webhooks.

Solution with webhook server:
```php
<?php

use Xsolla\SDK\Webhook\WebhookServer;
use Xsolla\SDK\Webhook\Message\Message;
use Xsolla\SDK\Webhook\Message\NotificationTypeDictionary;
use Xsolla\SDK\Exception\Webhook\XsollaWebhookException;

$callback = function (Message $message) {
    switch ($message->getNotificationType()) {
        case NotificationTypeDictionary::USER_VALIDATION:
            /** @var Xsolla\SDK\Webhook\Message\UserValidationMessage $message */
            // TODO if user not found, you should throw Xsolla\SDK\Exception\Webhook\InvalidUserException
            break;
        case NotificationTypeDictionary::PAYMENT:
            /** @var Xsolla\SDK\Webhook\Message\PaymentMessage $message */
            // TODO if the payment delivery fails for some reason, you should throw Xsolla\SDK\Exception\Webhook\XsollaWebhookException
            break;
        case NotificationTypeDictionary::REFUND:
            /** @var Xsolla\SDK\Webhook\Message\RefundMessage $message */
            // TODO if you cannot handle the refund, you should throw Xsolla\SDK\Exception\Webhook\XsollaWebhookException
            break;
        default:
            throw new XsollaWebhookException('Notification type not implemented');
    }
};

$webhookServer = WebhookServer::create($callback, PROJECT_KEY);
$webhookServer->start();
```

Solution with just helper classes in some php function:
```php

public function handleRequest()
{
    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();
    $message = Message::fromArray($request->toArray());

    switch ($message->getNotificationType()) {
        case NotificationTypeDictionary::USER_VALIDATION:
            /**
             * https://developers.xsolla.com/webhooks/operation/user-validation/
             * @var Xsolla\SDK\Webhook\Message\UserValidationMessage $message
             */
            if ($message->getUserId() !== 'our_user_id') {
                return YourResponseClass(json_encode(['error' => ['code' => 'INVALID_USER', 'message' => 'Invalid user']]), 400);
            }

            break;
        case NotificationTypeDictionary::PAYMENT:
            /** @var Xsolla\SDK\Webhook\Message\PaymentMessage $message */
            break;
        case NotificationTypeDictionary::REFUND:
            /** @var Xsolla\SDK\Webhook\Message\RefundMessage $message */
            break;
        default:
            throw new \Exception('Notification type not implemented');
    }

    return YourResponseClass('', 200);
}

```

Once you've finished the handling of notifications on your server, please set up the URL that will receive all webhook notifications on the Settings page for your project.
